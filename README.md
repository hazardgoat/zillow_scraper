# zillow_scraper
This script scrapes the Zillow website for listings matching the input query URL, and then outputs an ESRI shapefile of the matching listings. 
A neat feature of this script is that it allows for filtering listings using the Google Maps API by estimated travel time from listing locations to a given address, 
such as place of employment.

This script is not indended for commercial and/or at-scale purposes.
